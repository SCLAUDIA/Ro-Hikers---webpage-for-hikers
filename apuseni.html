        <p class="direction-description">The route starts from the center of Gârda de Sus village, on the asphalt road, until the confluence of Ordâncuşei valleys with Gârda Seacă. In front of a garage with the marking painted on it, the route turns right and climbs a winding path to the village of Munună, where it meets the asphalt road (DC260) that climbs to the village of Glacier. From here, the route does not leave the paved road to the Scărişoara Ethnography Museum to shorten some serpentines. From the museum we climb about 30 minutes to the Scărişoara Glacier Cave, on a paved road.</p>

    <p class="direction-description">From Cabana Râmeț we head towards the gorges, passing among many chalets and a few old houses. After 3 km, the road ends and we climb the stream entering the wild territory of the gorges. In some places the walls are so suitable they must be combined on the clamps installed on the slopes or not to undress and enter the water. We do not recommend going until summer, in warm weather. At the exit of the gorges, the isolated village of Cheia awaits us. A handful of kind people are rebuilding here traditional houses equipped with old objects that will form an "ethnographic conservation site". We change direction north along the Bradesti Valley. We continue along the valley, we go through a beech forest through which we always climb, then among the houses of the village of Bradesti reaching the top of the hill, where DJ107I passes. From here, we follow north, along Poienii Valley, through the scattered village of the same name, and after leaving Vânătarele Ponorului on the left, we meet route 5. The walk from Bradesti to here was almost 6 km. We descend through the forest to the entrance to the Huda lui Papară cave, where there is a spring and a resting place. At 150 m is the Stone Monastery. There are several guesthouses, chalets and old houses in the area. The settlement called Sub Piatră has been inhabited since ancient times and is full of legends. From here, the route descends to Sălciua using a good road, partially paved, along the Morilor Valley.</p>
